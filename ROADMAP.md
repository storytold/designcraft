# DesignCraft roadmap

**Stage: alpha** · next: beta, ~33 points and ~420–750 h away

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-10 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-10 · **Change:** major (full re-measure against InDesign 2026 21.6; restructured to the craftrules progress-docs standard) · **Target:** Adobe InDesign 2026

DesignCraft aims at full Adobe InDesign parity, and to be better: faster, open (documented JSON
format + IDML), scriptable by agents (MCP), and available on the web.

## Headline numbers

| | Value | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| **Feature breadth** | **~80%** (69% of InDesign 21.6's in-scope menu items matched; 99% of our 275-row checklist) | measured bounds, estimate between |
| **Ready for real work** | **~42%** (range 38–48%) | estimated, weighted by dimension |
| Remaining to **beta** | **420–750 Opus 5.5 agent-hours** (~120–200 wall-clock hours with 4–5 agents) | estimated |
| Remaining to **full parity** | **1,150–1,950 Opus 5.5 agent-hours** | estimated |

**Why alpha:** the core workflows exist end to end (new document, frames, threaded text with a
real paragraph composer, styles, tables, long-document features, IDML both ways, PDF/X-4), so it
is past pre-alpha. It is not beta: InDesign's own documents (`.indd`) can't be opened, IDML is
unproven on real files, composition hasn't been compared with InDesign's, and users on Windows
and Linux report basic editing failures (copy/paste, context menus, threading). Details:
[docs/target-app-parity.md](docs/target-app-parity.md).

## Upcoming

Ranked; detail and estimates in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md), the full list in
[docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md).

1. Basic editing on every platform: copy/paste, context menus, threading, caret formatting (30–50 h)
2. CI running `cargo xtask ci` on pull requests (4–8 h)
3. Open INDD through a clean-room converter, owner decision on #114 (20–60 h)
4. IDML real-file corpus and fixes (60–100 h)
5. Composition oracle against InDesign; optical kerning; overset rule (80–140 h)
6. Start on any GPU; find every installed font (25–50 h)
