//! Which graphics adapter the window renders with, and what happens when it can't show the window.
//!
//! The canvas is rendered on the CPU (`designcraft-render`); the GPU only composites it and draws
//! the interface, so any adapter that can present to the window will do. Which backends the
//! instance is created with is decided first, with a fallback for drivers that take the process
//! down ([`backend`]). Among the adapters of those backends, [`adapter_order`] ranks: those that
//! can't present to the window's surface never, then the one `WGPU_ADAPTER_NAME` names, hardware
//! before software, the native backends (Vulkan, Metal, DX12) before OpenGL, the GPU that drives a
//! display and the one that drives the primary display ([`display_gpus`]), the power preference
//! ([`power_preference`]) among the rest, and a GPU's DX12 adapter before its Vulkan one. eframe is
//! handed [`selector`], which takes the first of that order.
//!
//! A GPU without a monitor is the wrong one even when it can present: on a desktop whose monitors
//! all hang off the discrete GPU, power saving picked the Ryzen's integrated GPU, Windows had to
//! present every frame across adapters, and the integrated GPU's driver reset under that, which
//! lost the graphics device, or took the desktop's compositor and every monitor down for minutes.
//! So, unless `WGPU_POWER_PREF` says otherwise, the GPU that drives the display the user looks at
//! comes first, and the power preference only orders the rest. Windows says which adapter drives
//! which display (`EnumDisplayDevices`), Linux through sysfs; elsewhere, or when nothing matches,
//! the order is the power preference's.
//!
//! An adapter can report that it presents to the window and still fail once it does: on a hybrid
//! Linux desktop under Wayland, the compositor runs on one GPU and may refuse the frame buffers
//! another GPU allocates, which kills the window's Wayland connection; egui-wgpu then panics while
//! configuring the surface. Creating the device can fail too: on an Intel Mac, wgpu's check of
//! indirect draw arguments needs a compute shader the Metal driver couldn't compile, and the device
//! was lost before the window showed (#334; DesignCraft never draws indirectly, so that check is
//! off, [`instance_flags`]). Nothing in the process can show a window after that, so when the
//! graphics fail while the window is starting up, [`finish`] starts the app again without that
//! adapter, as the next one in the order would be tried. When no adapter of the start's backends
//! is left, it starts again with the next backend ([`backend::Fallback::next_after`]). Software
//! renderers (WARP, llvmpipe) come last of all: while a backend is left to try, a start passes
//! over them, and only once no hardware adapter of any backend could show the window does the app
//! start again with them allowed. Each restart leaves out one more adapter or backend, or allows
//! software once, so it ends when none is left.
//!
//! An adapter can also hang instead of failing: on a hybrid laptop, the discrete GPU never put the
//! window's first frame on the screen, with no error and no panic, and the app stayed in the
//! background without a window. [`watch_first_frame`] notices a first frame that is late and,
//! when the UI thread is stuck in the graphics stack for [`HANG_TIMEOUT`], starts the app again
//! without that adapter in the same way.
