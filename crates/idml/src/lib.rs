//! IDML (InDesign Markup Language) interchange: [`export_idml`] and [`import_idml`].
//!
//! Implemented clean-room from the public IDML File Format Specification and from inspecting
//! IDML packages exported from synthetic documents. An IDML package is a ZIP whose first entry is
//! an uncompressed `mimetype`, followed by `designmap.xml` (the root `Document` element that
//! includes the other parts) and the `Resources/`, `MasterSpreads/`, `Spreads/` and `Stories/`
//! parts.
//!
//! ## Coordinates
//! DesignCraft spreads have their origin at the top-left of the first page (y down). IDML spread
//! coordinates have their origin at the binding spine (facing pages) or the spread centre
//! (single-sided documents), vertically centred on the pages; pages are placed by their
//! `ItemTransform` and every page item's geometry is `PathGeometry` in inner coordinates mapped by
//! `ItemTransform` (inner → parent). Export maps `xf_idml = T(-origin) · xf`; import computes the
//! page rectangles from the page transforms and maps back.
//!
//! ## Supported subset
//! Swatches (process/spot CMYK, RGB and Lab colours, tints, linear/radial gradients), paragraph,
//! character and object styles (with `BasedOn` and style groups), fonts, document preferences
//! (page size, facing pages, bleed/slug, margins and columns including dragged column positions,
//! units, grids), ruler guides, layers, sections,
//! parent (master) spreads and applied parents, spreads and pages, page items (`TextFrame`,
//! `Rectangle`, `Oval`, `Polygon`, `GraphicLine`, `Group`) with fill/stroke, corner options, text
//! frame options (with column rules), text wrap, transparency (opacity, blend mode, drop shadow,
//! feather, gradient feather, directional feather), images (embedded `Contents` or linked), stories with paragraph/character style ranges and local overrides, special
//! characters and breaks, text threading, ruler and liquid guides, and stored page liquid rules.
//!
//! ## TODO (ignored on import / not written on export)
//! - Tables, footnotes, anchored/inline objects, notes, tracked changes, hyperlinks, index and
//!   cross-reference markers, text variables, conditions, XML structure (`XML/*` parts).
//! - Page-item overrides of parent items (only the page's `OverrideList` is read),
//!   parent-of-parent page mapping beyond `AppliedMaster`, alternate layouts, liquid object constraints.
//! - Nested/GREP/line styles, bullets & numbering details (bullet glyph, number format), OpenType
//!   feature flags, paragraph borders, grid alignment, custom dashed stroke styles; column rule
//!   stroke type and overprint.
//! - Mixed inks, gradient stop opacity, gradient feather stops between the first and last, its
//!   midpoints and highlight, directional feather angle, noise, choke and shape mode, other effects
//!   than drop shadow and the feathers, stroke/fill/content transparency, EPS/PDF/AI placed graphics (imported as images when the data is available),
//!   clipping paths, compound-path fill rules.
//! - Placed PDFs: the page (`PageNumber`) and crop choice (`PDFCrop`) round-trip, and
//!   `GraphicBounds` span the chosen box. Where that box sits on the page needs the PDF parsed,
//!   which this crate doesn't do: the engine finds it after import (`file.openIdml`), and when the
//!   PDF's data isn't available the page's crop box fills `GraphicBounds`. The content crops
//!   (`CropContentVisibleLayers`, `CropContentAllLayers`) are the bounds of what the page draws:
//!   its paths, text and images, each cut to the clip in force.
//! - Unknown elements are ignored; nothing is preserved opaquely for round-trip yet.
