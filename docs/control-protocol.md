# Control protocol

Start the app with `--control <port>` (or `DESIGNCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT`). The server listens on
`127.0.0.1` only and speaks JSON lines: one request object per line, one reply per line.

For an isolated native test profile, set `DESIGNCRAFT_CONFIG_DIR` to a dedicated directory before
launch. UI/engine preferences and the `Recovery` directory then live under that root. An unset
override preserves the usual platform paths; an explicitly empty override disables those paths.
`DESIGNCRAFT_NO_PREFS` still disables preference reads/writes independently of recovery.

Control pointer and key input is queued across native frames. After a drag, wait for both the
expected document state and `document.inspect.canUndo` before testing undo; an object can appear
in the preview before its undo entry is committed. On macOS, default shortcuts owned by the native
menu (including Command-Z) are skipped by the egui shortcut handler. `ui.key` does not send a Cocoa
menu event; use `ui.menu.invoke` for a menu-command test and test physical accelerators separately.

**Only requests are read.** Every line must be a JSON object with a string `method` (`id` and `params`
are optional; blank lines are skipped). Anything else gets one error reply
(`{"ok": false, "error": "… closing the connection"}`) and the server **closes the connection**, so
nothing sent after it on that connection runs. That covers text that isn't JSON, a JSON array or number,
an object without `method`, invalid UTF-8, and a line longer than 4 MiB. An HTTP request (for example a
web page's cross-origin `fetch` to `127.0.0.1:<port>`) therefore can't smuggle a command in its body:
its request line is rejected first. At most 16 connections are served at once; further ones get an error
line and are closed. Clients that get an error reply should reconnect. The port has no authentication,
so only enable it while you use it. Transport: `apps/designcraft/src/control_server.rs`.

```json
{"id": 1, "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "frame.create", "params": {"rect": [36, 36, 300, 200], "content": "text"}}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"id": 10, "story": 11}}
```

| Method | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` / `ui.menu.invoke` | `{command, params}` | Run any engine or UI command (see `engine.commands`). `ui.menu.invoke` without `params` acts like choosing the menu item: a command labelled "…" that takes parameters opens its dialog |
| `engine.commands` | — | Every command: id, label, menu path, shortcut, params doc, enabled |
| `document.inspect` | — | Pages, spreads, items, stories (overset), styles, swatches, selection |
| `ui.inspect` | — | Tool, UI state, view (zoom/origin), canvas rect, perf |
| `ui.menu.list` / `ui.tool.list` | — | Menu tree / Tools panel groups |
| `ui.tool.select` | `{tool}` | Select a tool (`selection`, `type`, `rectangleFrame`, …) |
| `ui.pointer` | `{events:[{kind: down\|drag\|up\|move\|doubleclick, x, y, space?: "screen"\|"canvas"}], mods?}` | Drive the active tool through the same code path as the mouse |
| `ui.key` / `ui.text` | `{key, shift?, alt?, cmd?}` / `{text}` | Synthetic keyboard input (typing into a text frame) |
| `ui.move` / `ui.click` / `ui.drag` | screen points, `button?: left\|right\|middle` | Real egui pointer input — reaches every widget, menu and panel |
| `ui.set` | `{brightness?, panel?, rulers?, guides?, frameEdges?, frameGrids?, baselineGrid?, textThreads?, screenMode?, zoom?, page?, fit?}` | UI state |
| `ui.dialog.open` | `{id, fields?}` | Open a dialog by id (e.g. `paragraphStyleOptions` or `characterStyleOptions` with `{name, section}`, or `{new: true}` for a new style) |
| `ui.dialog.set` / `ui.dialog.confirm` / `ui.dialog.cancel` | `{field, value}` | Fill and confirm the open dialog |
| `ui.resize`, `ui.focus` | | Window control |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?}` | PNG of the whole window |
| `ui.render` | `{path?, page?, scale?, bleed?}` | Render a page headlessly (PNG; base64 if no path) |
| `app.open` / `app.save` / `app.export` / `app.quit` | | Files |

Data merge runs through `engine.execute` like any command: `data.source.select`, `data.fields`, `data.placeholder.add` /
`.remove`, `data.options`, `data.preview` / `data.preview.stop`, `data.merge`. `data.merge` creates and activates a new
merged document; the template stays as it was ([agents.md](agents.md#data-merge)).

Headless window screenshots (locked screen, hidden window): `cargo run -p designcraft-ui-egui --example ui_shot -- script.jsonl`, where each line is one of the requests above, `{"shot": "/abs/out.png"}` or `{"steps": n}` (renders the whole UI offscreen with wgpu).

The MCP server (`designcraft-cli mcp`) wraps the same methods for Claude and other agents.

## Shared panel docking

Panel arrangements support tab grouping and reordering, horizontal and vertical splits,
and movable, resizable floating groups inside the application window. Drag a panel tab,
or use its context menu. Floating groups remain within the application viewport.

The shared layout begins with the existing workspace on the first docking operation.
Workspace saves retain its groups, active tabs, split sizes, floating geometry, and the
positions of hidden panels. Resetting a built-in workspace restores its default dock.

- `window.panel.move {panel, anchor, zone?, before?}` moves a panel into the target group.
  `zone` is `tab` (default), `center`, `left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom`; `before` reorders
  tabs by panel ID. The destination must already be visible.
- `window.panel.float {panel, x?, y?, width?, height?}` detaches a panel.
- `window.panel.dock {panel, anchor?, zone?, before?}` returns a panel to its previous
  dock placement when possible, or to the supplied destination.
- `window.panel.activate {panel}` reveals and selects a panel, restoring its saved
  position when possible. `window.panel.close {panel}` hides it.

Panel IDs are stable across themes. Invalid IDs, non-finite or invalid geometry, and
invalid destinations return an error without changing the arrangement.

`window.panel.layout {action}` also accepts the shared, externally tagged action schema.
For example, `{"action":{"MoveFloating":{"panel":"properties","rect":[44,66,360,450]}}}`
updates a floating group's position and size; `{"action":{"ResizeSplit":{"path":[],"size":{"Ratio":0.35}}}}`
resizes the root divider (`false`/`true` path entries select first/second children).
`Move` with `placement: {"Tab":{"before":"swatches"}}` reorders tabs, and
`SetStackOpen {panel,open}` / `ResizeStack {panel,height}` control accordion entries.
The UI dispatches these same commands. Unknown panel IDs, invalid geometry, and stale
split paths return an error without changing the workspace.

After panel customization, `app.tablePanel` (including Shift+F9) still toggles the
Table panel. `ui.set` with `closePanel` closes the last explicitly opened panel;
`dockExpanded:false` hides the root dock while floating groups remain visible.
The icon rail can reopen a collapsed dock through any root panel. Activating a
floating panel also raises its group. These operations change only UI layout.
