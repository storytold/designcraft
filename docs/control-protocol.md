# Control protocol

Start the app with `--control <port>` (or `DESIGNCRAFT_CONTROL_PORT`). The server listens on
`127.0.0.1` only and speaks JSON lines: one request object per line, one reply per line.

**Only requests are read.** Every line must be a JSON object with a string `method` (`id` and `params`
are optional; blank lines are skipped). Anything else gets one error reply
(`{"ok": false, "error": "… closing the connection"}`) and the server **closes the connection**, so
nothing sent after it on that connection runs. That covers text that isn't JSON, a JSON array or number,
an object without `method`, invalid UTF-8, and a line longer than 4 MiB. An HTTP request (for example a
web page's cross-origin `fetch` to `127.0.0.1:<port>`) therefore can't smuggle a command in its body:
its request line is rejected first. At most 16 connections are served at once; further ones get an error
line and are closed. Clients that get an error reply should reconnect. The port has no authentication,
so only enable it while you use it. Transport: `apps/designcraft/src/control_server.rs`.

```json
{"id": 1, "method": "engine.execute", "params": {"command": "frame.create", "params": {"rect": [36, 36, 300, 200], "content": "text"}}}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"id": 10, "story": 11}}
```

| Method | Params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `engine.execute` / `ui.menu.invoke` | `{command, params}` | Run any engine or UI command (see `engine.commands`). `ui.menu.invoke` without `params` acts like choosing the menu item: a command labelled "…" that takes parameters opens its dialog |
| `engine.commands` | — | Every command: id, label, menu path, shortcut, params doc, enabled |
| `document.inspect` | — | Pages, spreads, items, stories (overset), styles, swatches, selection |
| `ui.inspect` | — | Tool, UI state, view (zoom/origin), canvas rect, perf |
| `ui.menu.list` / `ui.tool.list` | — | Menu tree / Tools panel groups |
| `ui.tool.select` | `{tool}` | Select a tool (`selection`, `type`, `rectangleFrame`, …) |
| `ui.pointer` | `{events:[{kind: down\|drag\|up\|move\|doubleclick, x, y, space?: "screen"\|"canvas"}], mods?}` | Drive the active tool through the same code path as the mouse |
| `ui.key` / `ui.text` | `{key, shift?, alt?, cmd?}` / `{text}` | Synthetic keyboard input (typing into a text frame) |
| `ui.move` / `ui.click` / `ui.drag` | screen points, `button?: left\|right\|middle` | Real egui pointer input — reaches every widget, menu and panel |
| `ui.set` | `{brightness?, panel?, rulers?, guides?, frameEdges?, baselineGrid?, textThreads?, screenMode?, zoom?, page?, fit?}` | UI state |
| `ui.dialog.open` | `{id, fields?}` | Open a dialog by id (e.g. `paragraphStyleOptions` or `characterStyleOptions` with `{name, section}`, or `{new: true}` for a new style) |
| `ui.dialog.set` / `ui.dialog.confirm` / `ui.dialog.cancel` | `{field, value}` | Fill and confirm the open dialog |
| `ui.resize`, `ui.focus` | | Window control |
| `ui.screenshot` | `{path?}` | PNG of the whole window |
| `ui.render` | `{path?, page?, scale?, bleed?}` | Render a page headlessly (PNG; base64 if no path) |
| `app.open` / `app.save` / `app.export` / `app.quit` | | Files |

Data merge runs through `engine.execute` like any command: `data.source.select`, `data.fields`, `data.placeholder.add` /
`.remove`, `data.options`, `data.preview` / `data.preview.stop`, `data.merge`. `data.merge` creates and activates a new
merged document; the template stays as it was ([agents.md](agents.md#data-merge)).

Headless window screenshots (locked screen, hidden window): `cargo run -p designcraft-ui-egui --example ui_shot -- script.jsonl`, where each line is one of the requests above, `{"shot": "/abs/out.png"}` or `{"steps": n}` (renders the whole UI offscreen with wgpu).

The MCP server (`designcraft-cli mcp`) wraps the same methods for Claude and other agents.

## Interface appearance

`window.brightness {"brightness":"system"}` and `ui.set {"brightness":"system"}`
select System in the same checked Window > Interface Color Theme menu used by native and
in-window menus. The five manual values remain `dark`, `mediumDark`, `mediumLight`, `light`
and `highContrast`; new installs still use Medium Dark. `ui.json` stores `"brightness":"System"`
independently of the displayed palette. System resolves Light reports to Light, Dark reports to
Medium Dark, and a missing appearance to Medium Dark. Interface changes do not edit document,
page, canvas content or presentation settings. The pasteboard and rulers use interface tokens.

macOS and Windows use eframe/winit startup reports and ThemeChanged events. Native window
appearance remains inherited in every mode so switching from a manual palette to System can
use the latest desktop report. Both egui style branches contain the resolved palette, so manual
choices, including High Contrast, ignore desktop transitions.

Linux subscribes to the XDG Settings portal `org.freedesktop.appearance` / `color-scheme` before
its initial Read, then follows SettingChanged signals without polling. Portal 1 means Dark,
2 means Light, and 0 or an unknown value means no preference. Startup does not wait for portal
I/O; the first result requests a frame, including a late or unavailable result. If setup or
subscription fails, or Read supplies no preference, System uses Medium Dark. The appearance
reader owns its watcher; dropping the reader cancels setup, Read or idle reception and joins
the worker. An ended subscription clears the cache; portal restart/reconnection is not supported.
Browser builds use the appearance reports supplied by eframe and retain their existing storage
behavior. There is no desktop polling or periodic Preferences repaint.

For offscreen palette proof, `ui_shot` also accepts `{"systemTheme":"light"}`,
`{"systemTheme":"dark"}` and `{"systemTheme":null}`. These are injected input, not native OS tests.
